## Final
- Final on concurrency and Security
- Cryptographic hash functions are: 
  - deterministic, given the same input it always produces the same hash
- An advantage of asymmetric key encryption is
  - it only requires one of the keys in the pair for encryption
  - public/private key
  - slower, requires a key
  - RSA is asymetric
- Symmetric can encypt any length of data
- Secure key exchange is uually done with
  - asymmetric encryption of a symmetric key
  - encrypt with asyemetric public key you can only read it
- Parallelism is;
  - Running things at the same time, need multiple processors
  - concurrently: means I have multiple threads, not necicarily running at the same time
    - single processor
- A race condition happens when:
  - two threads modify an access a critical resouce at the same time
- A critical section
  - defines code that may contain a race condition
  - contains a critical resource
  - modify or read shared memory
  - NOT: apply to single threaded programs
- Synchronized keyword
  - protects a critical section
- You can create a thread in Java using
  - an extended Thread object
  - a runnable object
    - implements the run method
    - returns void
  - a callable object
    - returns a result
- Thread pools always
  - add overhead
  - can 
    - grow dynamically (can create a thread pool of a fixed size)
    - have multiple threads (can just be one)
    - increase performance (it can)
- Thread 
  - you can make a thread wait for another read
  - t1.start()
  - t1.join() -- whatever thread calls this thread (main) will finish this thread before moving on
  - t2.start()
  - t2.join()
  - once you start a thread you don't have any control over when it goes, if you want control you join() it. 
- Database Transactions
  - don't allow partial executino of statemnets
  - increase copmlexity
  - require a commit
  - enable synchronization
- Hashing with Salt
  - store passwords uniquely
- Asymmetric Encryption
  - uses public/private key pairs
- Hash functions are not a good choice for:
  - encryption -- can't go back once you hash something -- encryption you want to decrypt
  - good for:
    - digital signatures
    - unique identifiers
    - data comparison 
- Asymetric Key pair 
  - you can decrypt data that was encrypted with the OTHER key in the pair

## AWS
- EC2 - lease a server, specify what should be on the machine and when you start it up and they pick a machine to run it on
- Security Group - specifies what ports can be run on your server
- Instances - pay by size
- Key Pair - how you log into your server
  - SSH: secure shell, how you access your server from a remote terminal
  - Have to secure the file, the pem key can't be a public file
  - chmod 600 user has all permissions except to excecute and no one else has permissions

## command-line builds
- steps
  - retreiving source code
  - download/resolve dependencies
  - complining code
  - run tests
  - verify code quality
  - package compiled code into a distributable format (jar files)
  - intalling/deploying software
- Automate it so anyone can do it and you get the same result
  - Continuous integration and deployment
- Common tools for command-line builds
  - Java: maven, gradle
  - C/C++: Make
  - JavaScript: npm
  - Python: Poetry, PyBuilder
  - Universal: Shell Scripts
- Maven build
  - mvn clean: wipes out compiled code
  - mvn install: compiile, package, tests, instals the projects and deploys it
  - mvn site: generates a website for the project code
- examples with Maven
  - cd server; mvn exec:java
- Maven has a specefic project structure
  - home
    - src
      - main  
        - java
        - resources (config files)
      - test
        - java
        - resources
    - target
    - pom.xml
- Automatically make a mvn project
  -  mvn archetype:generate -DgroupdId=edu.byu.cs240 -DartifactId=chess -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DinteractiveMode=false
- Multi-Module projects
  - server
  - client
  - shared
- Dependencies
  - pom.xml
    - model version
    - maven coordinates (groupId, artifactId, version)
    - name
    - URL
    - properties
    - dependencies
      - Alwyas say yes to IntelliJ when it asks you if you want to sync
      - Scope: compile, test, runtime
    - build (plugins)
    - reporting (plugins)
- Plugins
  - configure dependencies (example set a port on server.server.main)
  - mvn pluginName:goalName
    - run specefic tests from a plugin
- Default lifecycle
  - can put plugins into specefic steps
  - lots of steps when you call deploy
  -
