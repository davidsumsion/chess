###Json and Json Parsing Phase 3 (and phase 2 for the design)
- JSON and XML are the two datatypes for the internet
  - XML is mostly for configuration files
- Supported Datatypes
  - objects, arrays, numbers, strings, boolean, null
- Parsers
  - Serializers/Deserializers
    - Gson
    - directly converts it for you into a class
    - Gson gson = new GsonBuilder()set.
    - @Serializedname
    - 
  - Stream Parsers
    - tokenize things one token at a time
  - DOM parsers
    - read into memory, represented as a tree

### Phase 2:
- read phase 2 and phase 3 assignment
- understnad 3, create diagrams of 3
- sequence diagrams
- one sequence diagram for every endpoint
- HTTP
  - How a client connects with a server
  - Server
    - Web Site
    - Web API
  - Clients
    - Web Browser (Test Page) (Website and API)
    - Client App (API)
    - Test Driver (JUnit tests) (API)
- Design principles
  - Single Responsibility Principle
  - Avoid Code Duplication
  - Information Hiding
    - What you hide you can change
- Chess Server Models (Model Classes)
  - User class
  - AuthToken
  - Game
    - username of white/black user, contains ChesGame
  - (ChessGame, ChessPiece, ChessBoard, ChessMove)
- Model Classes 
  - user authtoken game
- Data Access
  - UserDao
  - AuthTokenDao
  - GameDao
- Server -> handlers-- json/http(registration, login, clear, join) -> request/result
- client app - server
  - IP address for server and client app
    - DNS server -- translates names to IP addresses
      - caches results from upper level DNS servers they inherit from
  - port is an "extension" for the IP address "office phone number"
- URL
  - protocol
    - http/https
  - domain name
    - www.google.com:
  - port number
    - 443 (specefic program)
    - don't have to include unless you want to, automatic
  - path
    - /images/branding/googlelogo/1x/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png
- GET request on server with path
  - Headers
    - Accept: image/png, image/gif, image/jpg
      - what images are acceptable
    - Accept-Encoding
      - gzip, deflate if its sent in accept formats
    - User-Agent
      - what browser request was from
  - Response
    - HTTP/version StatusCode ReasonPhrase
      - HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        - 200 range successful
        - 300 is informational, redirects
        - 400 server considers what you sent it to be an error
        - 500 means the server failed (sometimes sent as a 400, programs/companies don't like to admit they're wrong)
      - Headers
        - content-type: image/png
        - Content: length: 5969
        - Last modified:
        - blank line
      - body:
        - PNG image bytes
  - WebAPI call with HTTP
    - GET url path HTTP version
    - authorization: 3333333 (authtoken)
    - read
- POST request
  - Create something in Web API
  - POST URL_path HTTP/Version
  - Headers
    - list of headers 9content type, accept,accept encoding, content length
  - Request body
    - keywords = byu&cs&240
- GET: Retreive
  - read operation in a REST API
  - Body should normally not be included in request
- POST: Submit something to the specified resource, often causing a change or side effect
  - create operation in a REST API
  - body included in request
    - Change in DB/Server (logining in an individual)
- PUT
  - Replace 
  - an update operation in a REST API
  - Body included in request
- DELETE
- Others
  - HEAD, ÐžPTIONS, TRACE, PATCH
